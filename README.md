# self-playing-snake


Snake neural network that plays snake. Backend and frontend snake game implemented using pygame. Used numpy and pytorch to manipulate data and implement reinforcement learning and Deep Q Learning to teach agent how to play snake.


Early generations of the snake plays the game rather poorly, usually hitting an obstacle without eating an apple.
